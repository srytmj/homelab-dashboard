## 1. Executive Summary

As self-hosted homelabs evolve, they frequently fall victim to **"Observability Bloat"** and **"Tab Fatigue"**. In our compact Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q Tiny production node, maintaining visibility across 28 running containers previously required running four separate management tools totaling **six background containers**:

1. **Netdata** (`:19999`): Second-by-second host and container kernel telemetry.
2. **Uptime Kuma** (`:3001`): Internal HTTP latency and container ping polling.
3. **Portainer CE** (`:9000`): Container lifecycle management and log inspections.
4. **Homelable** (`:3000` & `:8001`, 3 containers): Dashboard links and service discovery.

Each tool operated independent background polling cycles, consumed precious RAM, wrote redundant logs to internal NVMe storage, and forced the operator to jump between multiple browser tabs to diagnose a single failing service.

By designing and deploying **Homelab Cockpit**—a unified, minimalist, single-binary container daemon—we officially decommissioned and removed all six redundant containers.

## 2. Empirical Benchmark (Before vs After)

| Metric | Before (Fragmented Stack) | After (Homelab Cockpit) | Delta / Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Observability Containers** | **6 containers**<br>*(Netdata, Kuma, Portainer, Homelable x3)* | **1 container**<br>*(`homelab-cockpit` on `:8050`)* | **-83.3%** container reduction |
| **NVMe SSD Storage** | Bloated layers, cache & volumes | Cleaned via `docker system prune -af` | **15.27 GB Freed** |
| **LXC RAM Consumption** | High baseline memory pressure | **~2.2 GB** used out of 12 GB alocated | **9.8 GB Free Headroom** |
| **Browser Tabs for Operations** | 4 tabs minimum | **1 unified Cockpit tab** | **-75%** context switching |
| **Telemetry Network Traffic** | 4 separate polling loops | 1 multiplexed WebSocket stream (2s) | **Zero polling storm** |
| **Access Control** | Fragmented / Inconsistent | 1x Owner Setup + 30-day token auth | **Zero-trust external access** |
| **Tailscale Routing Visibility** | Blind / Guesswork | Explicit `TS 100.x` vs `LAN 192.x` badges | **Instant 1-click routing** |

## 3. The Problem: The Cost of Fragmented Tools

### 3.1 Resource Starvation on Tiny Form-Factor Hardware
The Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny series is famous for its power efficiency (~15W-25W idle), but Intel Core i5-7500 (4 cores, 4 threads) and 32GB RAM must be budgeted responsibly when running media transcoding (Jellyfin), document OCR (Paperless-ngx), cloud synchronization (Nextcloud), and developer environments (T3 Code).

Running separate containers for logs (Dozzle/Portainer), metrics (Netdata), health checks (Uptime Kuma), and links (Homelable) resulted in:
- High constant CPU interrupt overhead from conflicting background poll loops.
- Significant disk write amplification on the internal NVMe boot SSD.
- Inability to correlate events (e.g. knowing whether a Jellyfin playback failure was caused by high CPU, network saturation, or an unmounted external DAS drive).

### 3.2 Tab Fatigue and Operational Lag
During an incident, the homelab owner had to:
1. Open **Portainer** to check container states and read stderr logs.
2. Open **Netdata** to inspect CPU temperature and thermal throttling.
3. Open **Uptime Kuma** to see if port 8096 was actually accepting HTTP requests.
4. SSH into **Proxmox VE** to check if the external multi-bay USB DAS had randomly disconnected or if nightly vzdump backups had completed.

## 4. The Architectural Solution: Homelab Cockpit

Instead of stitching together multiple third-party SaaS-like containers, **Homelab Cockpit** was engineered as an all-in-one, owner-centric operations hub:

### Key Architectural Replacements:
1. **Replaced Portainer & Dozzle**: Native Dockerode integration provides instant in-app log streaming (50-500 lines, auto-scroll, copy) and graceful restart with confirmation dialogs.
2. **Replaced Netdata & Health Daemons**: Lightweight OS sensor polling combined with L7 HTTP probers directly verifies whether container web ports return `200 OK` (with millisecond latency) or `502 Bad Gateway`.
3. **Replaced Fragmented Dashboards**: Integrated **Container Fleet Table** displays explicit `TS 100.110.20.15:PORT` and `LAN 192.168.18.225:PORT` links side-by-side with 1-click clipboard copy.
4. **Hardened for Remote Access**: An automated **1x Owner Registration Wall** locks public registration permanently after initial setup and issues 30-day authenticated session tokens, allowing the dashboard to be safely exposed to the internet via Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale Funnel.

## 5. Decommissioning & Cleanup Procedure

Following the deployment and validation of `homelab-cockpit` on port `:8050`, the legacy stack was purged:

```bash
# 1. Stop and remove the legacy monitoring stacks
docker stop netdata uptime-kuma portainer homelable_web homelable_api homelable_db
docker rm netdata uptime-kuma portainer homelable_web homelable_api homelable_db

# 2. Reclaim dangling layers, build cache, and obsolete container volumes
docker system prune -af --volumes

# Output:
# Total reclaimed space: 15.27GB
```

### Resulting Host Vitals:
- **LXC RAM Usage**: **2.18 GB** active memory (out of 12.0 GB allocated).
- **Available RAM Headroom**: **~9.8 GB** unreserved memory available for production workloads.
- **NVMe SSD Utilization**: Reduced significantly, preserving flash write endurance on the boot SSD.

## 6. Homelab Owner Testimonial

> *"Dulu setiap kali mau troubleshooting homelab, minimal harus buka 4 tab: Portainer buat liat logs, Netdata buat liat CPU throttle, Uptime Kuma buat ngecek service up/down, dan SSH Proxmox buat mastiin kabel DAS ga copot. Belum lagi container monitoring-nya sendiri makan RAM dan bikin CPU mikir terus.*
>
> *Dengan Homelab Cockpit, 6 container lama langsung gw pensiunkan total. Sekali `docker system prune -af`, 15.27 GB SSD NVMe langsung lega dan RAM LXC sisa 2.2 GB dari 12 GB. Sekarang cukup buka 1 web, semua rute Tailscale IP keliatan jelas, logs bisa langsung diintip, dan aman dibuka dari luar kosan berkat 1x owner auth wall. Benar-benar definisi clean and purposeful engineering."*

### 🚀 Case Study: Slashing 83% Monitoring Bloat in My Homelab with a Custom Cockpit

**The Problem**: Running 28 self-hosted containers on an Intel Core i5 Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q Tiny created severe observability bloat. Four disjointed tools (Netdata, Portainer, Uptime Kuma, Homelable) across six containers consumed over 3GB of RAM and required constant tab-hopping.

**The Solution**: Built **Homelab Cockpit**—a full-stack real-time telemetry daemon (TypeScript, Fastify, React, Tailwind CSS, WebSocket) tailored for compact nodes running Proxmox VE, Docker LXCs, Tailscale mesh networks, and external multi-bay USB DAS mounts.

**The Hard Numbers**:
- 📉 **-83.3% Container Reduction**: Replaced 6 containers with a single lightweight daemon.
- 💾 **15.27 GB NVMe SSD Reclaimed**: Cleaned obsolete image layers and volumes.
- ⚡ **9.8 GB Free RAM Headroom**: LXC memory consumption dropped to ~2.2 GB / 12 GB.
- 🌐 **Zero-Guesswork Routing**: Real-time Tailscale (`100.x`) vs LAN (`192.x`) routing badges with built-in L7 HTTP health probes and 1x owner lockdown auth.
